---

**Project Onchain Wikipedia** is an innovative initiative aimed at bringing the extensive functionality and inner workings of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) onto the [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)<sup>[1](#1)</sup>, initially developed by [builder]() [Mubarak Usmane]() during the 2024 [Onchain Summer]() "[Buildathon]()"—an annual [hackathon]() hosted by [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com)'s [Layer 2 network](), [Base](https://base.org). This project leverages [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)<sup>[2](#2)</sup> to create a decentralized, transparent, and immutable encyclopedia. Project Onchain Wikipedia represents a significant step towards the fusion of blockchain technology and open knowledge dissemination<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>.

## Background

The idea for Project Onchain Wikipedia was born out of the desire to address some of the limitations and vulnerabilities of traditional web-based knowledge platforms. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)<sup>[3](#3)</sup>, while immensely popular and valuable, faces challenges such as centralization, censorship, and data integrity<sup>[3](#3)</sup>. By utilizing [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)<sup>[1](#1)</sup> technology, Project Onchain Wikipedia aims to ensure that all contributions and edits are permanently recorded on the blockchain, making tampering or unauthorized changes virtually impossible<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. By eliminating the need for a central authority to manage and moderate content, the project empowers the community to govern the platform<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. Additionally, providing a transparent history of all edits and contributions allows users to trace the origin and evolution of content<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>. Project Onchain Wikipedia leverages the decentralized nature of the blockchain to ensure that data is immutable and transparent<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>. By recording every transaction on the blockchain, the project ensures that all information is verifiable and traceable<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>. This is a significant departure from traditional platforms where data can be altered or censored by central authorities<sup>[3](#3)</sup>.

## Design

<br>**Architecture**

Project Onchain Wikipedia is built on a robust architecture that integrates several blockchain technologies and protocols. The core components include smart contracts, which are the backbone of the platform, handling everything from user contributions to content verification and dispute resolution<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. Smart contracts automate the process of content submission, review, and approval, ensuring that the system operates efficiently and transparently without the need for intermediaries<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. The InterPlanetary File System ([IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System))<sup>[4](#4)</sup> is used for decentralized storage of media files, ensuring that large files can be stored off-chain while their references remain on-chain<sup>[4](#4)</sup>. This approach not only reduces the burden on the blockchain but also ensures that data remains accessible and resilient to censorship<sup>[4](#4)</sup>. Governance of the platform is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization))<sup>[5](#5)</sup>, where community members can propose and vote on changes and improvements<sup>[5](#5)</sup>. This decentralized governance model empowers users and ensures that the platform evolves according to the collective will of its contributors<sup>[5](#5)</sup>.

<br>**Smart Contracts**

The [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)<sup>[2](#2)</sup> in Project Onchain Wikipedia are designed to manage various aspects of the platform, including content submission, content review, and dispute resolution<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. Users can submit new articles or edits to existing articles, with each submission recorded on the blockchain, along with the submitter's details and a timestamp<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. This ensures that all contributions are transparent and attributable, discouraging malicious or low-quality edits<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. A decentralized review process ensures that submissions meet the platform's standards, with reviewers selected randomly from the community and their decisions recorded on-chain<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. This decentralized approach to content moderation ensures that reviews are fair and unbiased<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. In case of disputes over content, the platform employs a dispute resolution mechanism where community members can vote on the validity of the content<sup>[2](#2)</sup>. This ensures that contentious issues are resolved democratically, with the community having the final say<sup>[2](#2)</sup>.

<br>**Layer 2 Scaling Solutions**

Project Onchain Wikipedia is hosted on [Base](https://base.org), a Layer 2 scaling network on [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum)<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. Layer 2 solutions are crucial for enhancing the scalability and efficiency of blockchain applications<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. Layer 2 solutions, like Base, significantly increase the number of transactions that can be processed per second, reducing congestion on the main Ethereum network<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. This allows the platform to handle a larger number of users and interactions simultaneously<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. By offloading transactions from the main Ethereum chain, Layer 2 networks lower gas fees, making it more cost-effective for users to interact with the platform<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. This reduction in costs is essential for encouraging widespread adoption and participation<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. Faster transaction times and lower costs improve the overall user experience, encouraging more participation and interaction with the platform<sup>[6](#6)</sup>. A seamless user experience is critical for attracting and retaining users<sup>[6](#6)</sup>.

<br>**DAO Structure**

The governance of Project Onchain Wikipedia is inspired by the community-driven approach of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org)<sup>[3](#3)</sup> but implemented through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization))<sup>[5](#5)</sup>. Similar to Wikipedia, members are ranked by their age and experience within the platform, ensuring that those with more knowledge and involvement have a greater influence on decisions<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>. Experienced members can mentor new contributors, fostering a collaborative and supportive community<sup><i>citation needed</i></sup>. Instead of using tokens, voting and proposals are conducted through signatures, ensuring that all members have an equal say, regardless of their financial stake<sup>[5](#5)</sup>. By decoupling governance from financial incentives, the platform promotes a more equitable and inclusive decision-making process<sup>[5](#5)</sup>. The Ethereum Attestation Service ([EAS](https://eas.ethereum.org))<sup>[7](#7)</sup> is used to handle attestations alongside signatures, storing metadata and providing additional context and verification for decisions made by the community<sup>[7](#7)</sup>. This enhances the transparency and accountability of the governance process<sup>[7](#7)</sup>. The DAO structure of Project Onchain Wikipedia ensures a decentralized governance model where power is distributed among the members, maintaining the integrity and fairness of the platform and preventing any single entity from gaining too much control<sup>[5](#5)</sup>.

<br>**Tokenomics and Donations**
